Project: neo-nilgiri.
28,342 lines of C++ code.

In 2004 I attempted to create my own flavor of DikuMUD entirely written in C++. I eventually abandoned this
project because I felt writing this in C++ was too easy to introduce bugs and I my time was drowned hunting
down errors and rewriting code to be more robust.

This code isn't packaged to be readily runnable.
